all above three should be in system variable path. google if you don't know about it.

There should be all_pdf folder in the script directory and all scanned pdf you want to get processed should be in this folder.

Make sure you have python3 installed and in the path. 

go to the zip file provided, extract it and go to the extracted folder. Write cmd on address bar and hit enter.

write       pip install -r requirements.txt           this line and it will install all the required libraries. 

then write      python pdf_scraper.py           it will run the script and it will first make all the pdf into system readable pdf in OCR_Document folder. 
then it will read the files from OCR_Documents folder and gives you the excel file named as code_enforcement_data.xlsx.
